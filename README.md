# SlotFinder 3

Test number 2

No more endless discussions to find a date: let us suggest the best times that suit everyone.

## Development Setup

You have two options to set up your development environment:

1. **Dev Container (Recommended)** - Complete development environment in Docker with IDE integration
2. **Local Setup** - Traditional setup on your host machine

### Option 1: Dev Container (Recommended)

#### Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Docker installed
   - VS Code with [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) OR Zed (recent version)

2. **Open in Container**

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/ZideStudio/SlotFinder
   cd SlotFinder

   # Open in VS Code
   code .
   # Then: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

   # OR open in Zed
   zed .
   # Then: Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → "projects: open dev container"
   ```

3. **Wait for Setup**
   - The container builds automatically
   - Infrastructure services start automatically (Traefik, PostgreSQL)

4. **Start the application**

   Run the following command inside the container (or use the VS Code task `make: start`):

   ```bash
   make
   ```

5. **Start Coding!**

### Option 2: Local Setup (with Docker)

#### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZideStudio/SlotFinder
cd SlotFinder
```

#### Install toolchain versions with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) (Node, npm, Go)

```bash
mise install
```

#### Set up environment variables

Clone the env `back/.env.model` file to `back/.env` and modify the variables as needed.

Note that the default values prefixed with `DB_` are already set and work with the dockerized development environment. You can change them if you want to connect to an external database.

#### Start the development environment

```bash
make docker-deps
```

```bash
make start
```

Access the application:

- **Frontend**: https://localhost
- **Storybook**: http://localhost:3002
- **Backend API**: https://localhost/api
- **Traefik Dashboard**: http://localhost:9000

To stop infrastructure:

```bash
make docker-deps-down
```

**Note**: The development environment uses self-signed certificates. Your browser will show a security warning - this is normal for local development. You can safely proceed by clicking "Advanced" > "Proceed to localhost".

### Database Access

Connect to the development database:

```
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Username: slotfinder
Password: slotfinder
Database: slotfinder
```

Example connection:

```bash
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U slotfinder -d slotfinder
```

### Infrastructure Commands

Start and stop Docker services (Traefik + PostgreSQL):

**Host Mode** (use when running frontend & backend on your machine, not in a dev container):

```bash
make docker-deps       # Start Traefik + PostgreSQL
make docker-deps-down  # Stop services
```

### Application Commands

```bash
make                # Start frontend and backend
make start          # Start frontend and backend
make front          # Start frontend only
make back           # Start backend only (with hot reload)
make storybook      # Start Storybook
```

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Rsbuild, TypeScript, Sass
- **Backend**: Go with Gin framework, PostgreSQL
- **Development**: Docker Compose with Traefik reverse proxy
- **Hot Reload**: Automatic updates for both frontend and backend
